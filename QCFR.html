                        <P>They cover a review of the following:</P>

                        </ul>
                        <P>They are a vital part of your practice’s on-going quality control procedures, they are also sometimes a specific requirement of your Regulator. </P>
                        <p>Metis Compliance Limited can undertake cold reviews on all types of audit assignments to allow you to comply with ISQC1 and ISA 220 or any requirement imposed by your regulator. We can also undertake cold file reviews on assurance
                            files, ‘client money audits’ or accountancy assignments. </p>
                        <p>Whilst these reviews are not usually time sensitive, we would try wherever possible to meet your deadlines and would aim to undertake them within 5 working days of a request being made.</p>
                        <p>Please note it is not appropriate for Metis to undertake a cold file review where we have previously undertaken <a href="#">a hot file review,</a> an <a href="#">Engagement Quality Control Review,</a> where we have offered a

                        <h3>Engagement Quality Control Review (EQCR) and Hot File Reviews</h3>
                        <P>These reviews are undertaken <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> the audit partner signs the audit report. </P>
                        <p>Hot file reviews are similar in nature to cold file reviews, there are two key considerations, to get the most out of them the audit file needs to be as finalised as it can be, also time needs to be allowed for the findings of
                            the hot file review to be appropriately actioned prior to signing the audit report.</p>
                        <p>An Engagement Quality Control Review (EQCR) are effectively a ‘focused’ hot file review which concentrates on significant judgements made and conclusions reached in formulating the auditor’s report. For example an EQCR may be limited
                            to reviewing the going concern status of the client or reviewing whether adequate consideration has been given to an ethical issue. These type of reviews may be a response to risk, to comply with the requirements of the FRC’s
                            Ethical Standard or the requirements of a regulator. It will usually be appropriate for the review to happen in two stages, a review of the planning, then a second review just before the assignment is finalised.</p>
                        <p>These types of reviews can also be taken on other types of assurance engagement and accountancy files.</p>
                        <p>At the end of each review, we will discuss our findings with you and issue you with a report which documents our findings, recommendations and conclusion.</p>
                        <p>We appreciate that this type of review is very time sensitive and will make every effort to meet your deadlines.</p>

                        <P><span style="font-weight:bold;">Failure to comply with the Money Laundering Regulations is probably the biggest regularity threat that practicing accountants face.</span></P>
                        <p>Metis’ Managing Director has a vast wealth of experience in the field of Anti-Money Laundering, having written anti-money laundering manuals, and having also worked for an IFAC Accountancy Regulator Body undertaking Anti-Money
                            Laundering Compliance Reviews.</p>
                        <p>It is mandatory to undertake an annual anti-money laundering compliance review, failure to do so is a criminal offence. Whether your regulator requires that this is undertaken by an external organisation or whether you feel it
                            would just be more beneficial to have it undertaken externally, Metis can undertake this review for you. </p>
                        <p>Also, unless you are a sole practitioner with no staff or subcontractors then there is also a requirement for this annual compliance review to be ‘audited’ again Metis can help you with this.</p>
